# Web Components Overview


## Way Back When

Way back when Internet web browsers and programming languages came along, I became interested in web technologies, and began learn by doing.

Creating a web page with the first version  of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and see it render by a web browser was exciting and straightforward. It required  learning a new programming language, figuring out what HTML syntax means, and figure out how the web page would look. Being able to style HTML with CSS was exciting. There were rough spots, when vendors changed the languages and browser supporting them.

It was an exciting event when web pages containing [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) happened. It added the capability for dynamic behavior after the web browser  loaded the page.

From way back when to present day, the troika of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) has become standard web programming languages that are interpreted and rendered by most web browsers

I am enthusiastic about contemporary Web Component Technology. It helps mitigate some of the costs  when adding functionality and maintenance, compared to web sites built with other technologies.
## Components and Templates

> View [Pete Hunt: React: Rethinking best practices - JSConf EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) software engineering presentation for the concepts of component and templates technologies, and the differences.

The cost of maintaining web site projects may be a magnitude or more than the development costs. The two software engineering principles  that determine development and maintenance  cost are coupling and cohesion

Coupling is:
> "The degree to which each program module relies on each of the other modules." More the coupling the more difficult it is to make fixes or add functionality. Coupling software increases maintenance costs.

Cohesion is:
> "The degree to which elements of a module belong together." This is the single responsible software engineering principle that decrease maintenance costs.

## Templates

Many web sites today are built with template web development frameworks.There are a  gaggle of them to choose from. 

Templates web development frameworks encourage a poor separation of concerns because they separate technologies, and requiring separate markup and logic programming files. 

A template framework cannot know how to separate concerns. It needs to provide powerful and expressive tools for the web developer to do it correctly.

Most of the template frameworks I have learned by doing have coupling problems when adding functionality or mitigating  software defects.

## Components

This web site is a result of learn by doing deep dives into web component technology. Adding functionality and maintenance is less difficult than template frameworks

Web Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) functions, but work in isolation.

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that enables creating new custom, reusable, encapsulated [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library or framework that works with HTML.
Cobbling a component technology web site using a component frameworks is different from template frameworks. React is a core component technology. React says this about Gatsby:

> "Gatsby is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to guarantee the fastest load time"


## Web Development Stack

A [Web Development Stack](webdevstack) is  a component web site generators abstracting other technologies, helping make developing web sites faster and more robust. The output of site generators are deployed to vendor cloud-based web services, eliminating the need for local web servers. The result is browsers rendering web pages by executing web standard [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) instructions,

## JSX

The core development technology of Gatsby and React is [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). React has created JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript.  JSX is not part of the web programming languages troika. Browsers do not understand JSX. React created a compiler to transform JSX code into standard web programming language at build time.

> JSX (JavaScript XML), is a React syntax extension to the JavaScript language. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. It is similar in appearance to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are written using JSX. 


> React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

> Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with cohesive components that contain both.

## Markdown

Markdown is a faster way of creating and maintaining web site content. It is a HTLM abstraction and that is compiled to web standard [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.

> "Markdown is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language used to add formatting elements to documents. Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown is not like that. In a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different."

Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. They are driven by the need for additional features like tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of additional features diverge from the reference implementation and informal specification, and have attracted attention. Not all flavors of Markdown are compatible or supported by all frameworks.

## MDX

I'm hesitant creating web site content without using a version of Markdown. My preference is using MDX.

MDX is Markdown for the component era. It enables writing JSX directly in Markdown documents. This enables writing  content containing components like tables, footnotes, and writing your own components without creating another Markdown implementation.
