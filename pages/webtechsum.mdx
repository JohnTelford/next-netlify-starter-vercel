# Web Technology Summary

A summary of technologies for creating web sites

## Hardware

Web site development is not easy and is time consuming. Optimizing the development environment is critical

The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large screens, and work with web software development applications.

## Software

Web site development is not easy, time consuming, and expensive. Optimizing the web development environment is critical. 

### Develop Locally

Developing web software using local development workstations and software is advantageous. The development environment is not locked into   vendor cloud services.  They can be updated with new and improved hardware and software quicker than relying on vendor cloud service to update


### Development Frameworks

Web development frameworks are local web site generators running on development workstations. They abstract other technologies, helping make developing web sites faster and more robust. The output is deployed to vendor cloud-based web services, eliminating the need for local web servers. The result is browsers render web pages by interrupting web standard [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) instructions generated by development frameworks.

### Web Components

Web Components are the web development technology for the component era. They are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) functions, but work in isolation.

Web components are based on existing web standards. They enable web developers to extend [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

### Source Code Editor

Choosing a source code editor that is also a local development project Central Command and Control stack, running on developers workstations, is an advantage. It is a fast and convent way to create, track changes, test, maintain, and deploying project web sites 
 
Quickly invoking live preview while editing source code is a time saver. It shows how edits will be displayed on the web. Quickly deploying a separate secure development web site enables project stake holders to quickly view development  and production progress, and make improvement suggestions.

When stake holders approve, the regular production  web site is updated.

### Version Control System

Version control helps answer the questions; *who changed what, where, when, and why?*

``Git`` is a  distributed version control system running on developer workstations for coordination with other developers and tracking  project file changes.

*GitHub* is an online web hosted repository for ``git`` projects. It is a platform for hosting versions of project files in a remote repository that is a unified source of truth for all developers.
